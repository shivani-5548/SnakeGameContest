@author -Shivani-More

Introduction

The Objective of the game are controlling the snake using key buttons, making it eat food, increasing the snake's size and scores, and ending the game when the snake collides with obstacles. The Game shows the snake game with a moving three-dot snake, a red dot for the head, green dots for the body, and an apple for the food. The only technology used for making the Snake game is Java Swing library, which provides lightweight components for making window-based applications. Classes that will be used in the game include J Button, J check boxes, combo box, J File Chooser, and J Frame.


Functionalities
Snake game built using Java and GUI made by using Java swing library. A user can provide directions to the snake using arrow keys and make it eat food. Also create snake collides with the border or body, the game gets over and score gets displayed to the user.

Snake!
Hi. For a final project, I used the concepts of collections, file I/O, inheritance/subtyping, and JUnit to create a simple Snake game with Java Swing.

The general idea and rules behind this game are explained in instructions.jpg. I will also add them below:

Welcome to Snake. You get to control a snake.

Use the [LEFT] [UP] [RIGHT] [DOWN] keys to move your snake.

RED apples will make your snake grow longer. Collecting them will give you 1 point each.

GOLDEN apples will make your snake move faster. Collecting them will give you 5 points each.

Try not to let your snake hit a wall or itself, or it will die and your game will be over.
